The only code used in the final project is the main file in the plant2.X folder. My Github decided it did not want to cooperate with me when I attempted to upload the project, so you will need to put that file into a fresh MP Lab X project in order to run it. Once it's there, however, (with the heap size set and relevant headers implemented, of course), you'll just need to upload it to the microprocessor.

These are the required headers:
"AD.h"
"serial.h"
"BOARD.h"
"ToneGeneration.h"
